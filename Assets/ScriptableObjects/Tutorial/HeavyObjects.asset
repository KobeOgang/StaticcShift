  tutorialTitle: Heavy Objects
  tutorialDescription: "You might notice that some objects are too heavy for you
    to lift. Your power has limits.\nBut certain smaller objects react to your energy.
    It feels like you can draw strength from them. You just have to find them...\n\n-
    Find an anchorable object. Press (RMB) to anchor and transfer its energy into
    you, allowing you to carry heavier objects. Press (RMB) again to release the
    anchor.\n\nWhile anchored, that object becomes immovable, even through normal
    physics means. This can be to your advantage\u2026 or not."
