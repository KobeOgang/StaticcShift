  noteTitle: Newspaper Headline on the Asteroid Hit
  noteContent: 'November 28, 2028: An Asteroid hit the the Pacific Ocean. While the
    impact did not directly damage civilian populations, the asteroid impact released
    electromagnetic waves across the world. A nauseous response was detected among
    some humans and animals. While initial examinations show there being no cause
    of concern, long lasting effects are still being examined.


    Scientists were
    quick to point a recent defect in several flora species that impedes their ability
    to photosynthesize. This unfortunately included a lot of major plant species,
    suggesting that Famine could take place in every country.'
