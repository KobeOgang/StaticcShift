  noteTitle: A Concerned Note
  noteContent: 'Dear Dr. Rascher,


    I know we''ve had concerns on quantity in
    the past, but the end of the month is closing in and we''re still 1.5 tons away
    from meeting the quota. Frankford labs will go bankrupt at this point we''re
    going.


    Project Sussex is depending on us.


    - Dr. Weber
