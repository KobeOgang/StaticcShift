  noteContent: "To the attendee:\n\nWhat do you mean you froze the Lifter?\n\nThe
    instructions were VERY clear. You're to only put 5 microliters of the cryogenic
    serum. That's enough to prime the internal organs for extraction. But no, you
    had to freeze the patient. Now who knows what'll happen to this Lifter. I'll
    report this to the superiors, but you know how costly screwing up one of these
    lifter proceedures, right?\n\nThat's tens of thousands of dollars. My advice?
    Prepare your bank. Get a loan! \n\nI'll try to see if something can be done here.
    You better  hope the lab results show something!\n\n- Dr. Rascher"
