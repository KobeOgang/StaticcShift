  noteContent: 'Dr. Rascher,


    Does it ever weigh on your conscience? That these
    Lifters - these people - we''re dissecting and extracting don''t deserve their
    untimely deaths? Just because they got influenced by that asteroid a few years
    ago, we''re killing them for it...


    It is indeed a technical marvel... These
    biokinetic materials we extracted can break up atoms themselves... But we could
    have done something good with it...  I know we need them for Project Sussex.
    For all we know, we might need these deaths to save all Americans.


    Still,
    I think about them from time to time. One of the Lifters we got was 15 years
    old, and just last week we killed him to extract kinetic essence from his head,
    all to power a nuclear bomb. Bombs everyone talks like it''ll solve all this
    lack of food.


    I''m tired, Dr. Rascher. I''m considering retiring. I don''t
    know how long I can endure this.


    Yours Truly,

    Dr. Weber'
