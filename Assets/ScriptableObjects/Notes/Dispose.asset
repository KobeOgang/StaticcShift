  noteTitle: Another Angry Note
  noteContent: 'To the attending staff:


    The serum preserves the body, but that
    doesn''t mean you''re to let it sit here and rot.


    I''ll remind you that
    the deceased body is a point of contagion? Who knows what sort of unique diseases
    these Lifters carry?


    The brain here is also done with extraction. Are we
    also waiting for it to rot in the fluid?


    - Dr. Rascher'
