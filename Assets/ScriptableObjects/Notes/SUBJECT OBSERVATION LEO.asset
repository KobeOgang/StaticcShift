  noteContent: 'SUBJECT OBSERVATION: MARKUS (EXPIRED)


    Status: Expired (Autopsy
    Pending)


    ID: S-06 [REDACTED]


    Condition: Cadaver. Severe calcification
    and rapid cellular degradation observed.


    Last Log: [Date, 4 years, 7 months,
    21 days ago]


    Notes: Subject S-06 suffered catastrophic systemic overload
    during power amplification trial. Brain activity spiked to unprecedented levels,
    followed by immediate and total organ failure. Bone density increased by 300%
    within minutes. The body effectively turned to stone... then crumbled. Containment
    of residual energy a primary concern. Suggest immediate incineration.
