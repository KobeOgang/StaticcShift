    We are officially in a state of war. Russia
    has bombed one of our military bases in California, murdering civilians.


    In
    lieu of Russia refusing to sign the Atlantic Treaty - the treaty that guaranteed
    peace and halted all production of nuclear weapons - and starting war, production
    will now triple its pace.


    The military will now take part in capturing
    Lifters and sending them to our various facilities.


    At any sign of bombing
    near the building, immediately leave the facility. '
